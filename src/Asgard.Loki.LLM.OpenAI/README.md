# Asgard.Loki.LLM.OpenAI

OpenAI LLM provider for Asgard.Loki.

| API | Complete result | Streaming |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chat Completions | Yes | SSE |
| Responses creation / continuation | Yes | SSE |
| Native Responses compaction | Yes, explicit target feature | No |

Create `OpenAiLlmProvider(IHttpClientFactory)` and register it in `LlmOptions.Providers`. Configure targets with a `/v1/` base address, actual model and credential. The default provider ID is `openai`; the named HTTP client is `Asgard.Loki.LLM.OpenAI`.

Preserves extension parameters, tools, reasoning items, cache controls, original response IDs, usage, error events and unknown JSON. Session routing uses the shared LLM module. Configure project/organization defaults through the named HTTP client if needed. Disable POST retries and hedging.

## Explicit compaction

The provider implements optional `IResponsesCompactionAdapter`. Set this on a target before using `loki.LLM.Responses.CompactAsync`:

```csharp
var target = new LlmTarget
{
    Id = "openai-compact", ProviderId = "openai",
    BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.openai.com/v1/"),
    UpstreamModel = actualModel, CredentialId = "openai-key",
    Protocols = LlmProtocol.Responses,
    Features = LlmTargetFeatures.ResponsesCompaction
};
```

Register the target in an `LlmRoute` with the provider, caller-supplied credential, HTTP factory and existing Session dependencies. The [root example](../../README.md#native-responses-compaction) shows explicit compact/next-create calls. `ResponseCompactionRequest` preserves text/item-array input, optional owned `PreviousResponseId`, and instructions/cache/future parameters. Only the logical-to-upstream model mapping changes; there is no injected `stream`, automatic history retrieval or resubmission.

`ResponseCompaction.Data` contains the complete native result, including usage and unknown fields. `Output` exposes the full returned array, including retained messages, tool IDs and opaque encrypted compaction items. Do not extract only the encrypted item or discard retained items. An ordinary response, missing output array or explicit error is rejected as an invalid compaction result. Its ID is not automatically bound as a generated response for future `previous_response_id` use.

First binding filters targets by the explicit feature; an existing Session always uses its original target and fails if it lacks compaction. Feature changes invalidate existing bindings. Enabling a feature is the caller's declaration that the configured upstream/model supports it, not a live entitlement check. OpenAI-compatible third-party endpoints may not implement this native operation. There is no compaction protocol conversion, streaming, auto-trigger or retry. [Official compaction behavior](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/compaction) and [endpoint fields](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/responses/methods/compact) were checked for this implementation.

Compaction tests exercise the public SDK with substitute HTTP handlers, complete-window replay, Session ownership, failed and cancelled calls and concurrent/stale first-binding decisions. No live OpenAI compaction or account entitlement verification has been performed.

Native Responses WebSocket is still not wired into this provider's public call surface. A separate transport checkpoint adds `IOpenAiResponsesWebSocketFactory` and internal bounded UTF-8 JSON framing. The factory is borrowed; the connection owns the socket returned by `ConnectAsync`. The default factory uses a single `ClientWebSocket` handshake without retry. A custom factory must change its `BindingIdentity` when its configuration semantics change. Provider integration and response/stream lifecycle validation follow in the next checkpoint, so the support table above remains unchanged.

Offline in-memory WebSocket tests cover byte fragmentation (including split Unicode), strict UTF-8, binary/malformed/oversized messages, inclusive size boundaries, input snapshots, serialized writes, cancellation, close interruption and socket ownership. A cancelled or failed operation that has entered socket IO makes the connection unusable; queued cancellation is not replayed. These tests do not connect to OpenAI or establish entitlement. Automatic history reconstruction and durable replay are not implemented.

For OpenAI Images Generations, install the independent `Asgard.Loki.Image.OpenAI` package. This LLM provider does not pull in image or audio dependencies.
